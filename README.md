The Serial API Multiplexer (“Serial Mux”) is a program that allows multiple processes to communicate with the SmartMesh IP Manager's Serial API over a TCP connection. 

On Linux, the Serial Mux runs as a process in the foreground. We welcome contributions for creating a Linux package or startup script. 

On Windows, the Serial Mux can be installed as a background service using the Serial Mux Installer.
